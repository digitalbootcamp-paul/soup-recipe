# soup-recipe
This is an online, live demo repo demonstrating how many cooks can collaborate on GitHub.

From a basic ingredient list and cooking method, we'll learn how a team can all work on a project collaboratively. Without a hint of command line.

1. make an account and sign up if you haven't already.
2. fork this repo
3. add your favorite ingredients, on your fork
4. create a pull request, discuss why you would add such a thing to soup
5. create a branch, with an alternate way to make soup (even if you just open a can)
6. create a pull request and discuss why it's an improvement.
7. we'll publish the repo as a github page.
